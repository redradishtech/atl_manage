Nagios/icinga plugin to aggregate results of multiple other nagios
plugin checks, returning most critical status of them all and joining
performance data. 

Based on idea presented on https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/check-many.html 
as other two implementations on https://exchange.nagios.org were lacking.

Currently it only supports reading commands from STDIN.

- if all checks are OK, it will return:
  MSG="All OK"
  PERF = msg1 --- perf1
         msg2 --- perf2
         msg3 --- perf3

- if at least one check is not OK:
  find most problematic last errorlevel and its MSG
  MSG="(Y non-OK): msgX" (msgX is message from worst errorlevel, and Y is  number of failed checks)
  PERF = msg1 --- perf1
         msg2 --- perf2
         msg3 --- perf3
