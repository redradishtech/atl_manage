# shellcheck shell=bash

## Bash library definings log and error functions:
##
## log()	Standard log message, printed with inline stacktrace
## LOG()	log(), but emphasised
## warn()	Like log() but in red
## debug()	log() but only prints if ATL_DEBUG=true
## error()	Like warn(), but prints a stacktrace and exits the script.
## quit()	Like error() but with no stacktrace.
##
## Also sets an ERR trap handler that prints a nice error() should any command fail. The message includes relevant variable values at time of failure.

#if [[ $(type -t log) = function ]]; then return 0; fi   # Avoid sourcing this file more than once.
